# Nicht-Nicht

"Nciht Nicht" is German and means "not not". It's a cool reaction game with different levels.

How to play:
Yust do what the game wants you to do:
if it says "up", press the up key
if it says "not right" press an arrow key that isn't the right key.
type the key before the timer runs out!
